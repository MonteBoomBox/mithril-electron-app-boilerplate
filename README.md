## An Electron App setup with MithrilJS and Bulma CSS

## Usage
For setting up your own project, perform the following steps:

1. Download this repo as a ZIP or clone it using `git clone https://github.com/MonteBoomBox/mithril-electron-app-boilerplate.git` in your folder.
2. Run `cd [yourprojectfoldername]` to move into your project folder.
3. Run `npm install` in order to install all the dependencies.
4. After making changes to your frontend code, run `npm start` for compiling your MithrilJS code.
5. For starting the Electron application, run `npm run startElectron`.

### Electron does not have hot reloading like React, so in order to see any changes in your app, press `Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R` for reloading the application.

Happy Developing!!
